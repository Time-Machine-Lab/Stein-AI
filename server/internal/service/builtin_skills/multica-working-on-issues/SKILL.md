# Working on Multica issues

Product contracts the runtime brief does not fully encode: PR linking vs close
intent, reading linked-PR state, metadata keys, status side effects, and
sub-issue enqueue behavior.

For building mention links, load `multica-mentioning` instead — not this skill.

Every contract below is traced to source in
`references/working-on-issues-source-map.md`.

## Graph-managed issues

When issue context contains `execution_mode: "graph"`, `graph_run_id`, or
`graph_node_run_id`, Graph owns execution, retry, parent completion and approval.
The ordinary status, PR-close and delegation guidance below does not advance
that run. Do not change its status, parent, assignee or execution metadata.

Inside a Graph node, read only the frozen context and submit its structured
result using the current task credential:

```bash
multica graph node context --output json
multica graph node download-inputs -o ./graph-inputs --output json
multica graph node submit --result-file /path/to/result.json --output json
multica graph node block --reason-file /path/to/diagnostics.json --output json
```

The download command retrieves frozen parent-task images and accepted upstream
artifacts into this attempt's directory, verifies hashes and extracts delivery
bundles. Inspect these images/files before declaring inputs inaccessible. Start
your own preview from delivered implementation files; another task's localhost
address and local paths are not a transferable service or file delivery.

For `produce_files`, keep only intended deliverables in a dedicated directory,
then run `multica graph node deliver ./output --output json`. Copy its returned
`artifact` unchanged into the top-level `result.artifacts` array. A text summary
alone cannot complete a file-producing node. Credentials, runtime state, links
and dependency directories are rejected by the packaging command.

For a node without code artifacts, a passing result is
`{"outcome":"pass","output":{"summary":"Completed"}}`, with `output` matching
the node's declared schema. The CLI binds omitted identity to the current
attempt; it rejects a supplied identity from another attempt. The block file
is a nonempty diagnostics object, for example
`{"reason":"Required test service unavailable"}`. Keep result files outside
the repository checkout. An unchanged result reuses a stable idempotency key.

For `produce_commit`, commit locally and declare the exact `git_commit` artifact
described in the execution manifest and prompt, with a freshly generated UUID as
its `id` (never the commit SHA); the daemon verifies and pushes
the managed ref after execution stops. For `verify_commit`, keep HEAD at the
frozen candidate, leave the checkout clean and return its `tested_commit_sha`.
Do not replace structured submission with a comment, PR, exit code or a manual
issue status change. Submission is staged: submit once, publish the report below,
then exit so the daemon can provide its stopped receipt and the engine can
validate the result.

After a successful submit or block, post one concise end-of-attempt report with
`multica graph node comment --body-file <path>`. Write the UTF-8 file inside the
task workdir but outside the repository checkout. Use the task's language and
roughly 100-300 Chinese characters, or a similarly brief paragraph or up to
three bullets in other languages. Summarize completed work, key findings,
checks actually performed, and remaining issues; for a blocker or
`needs_changes`, explain what is needed next. Omit tool logs, raw JSON, internal
IDs and local paths. State that the result or blocker was submitted and awaits
validation, without claiming Graph acceptance, artifact delivery or human
approval. Publish at most one end-of-attempt report per attempt. If posting
fails, exit without changing or resubmitting the staged result.

Human operators use `multica graph list`, `graph get <run-id>`, `graph run`, and
the revision-checked control commands. Check `multica graph --help` and each
command's help for flags. Mutations require an explicit `--idempotency-key`;
reuse it only for the identical request. Commands changing a saved revision
also require `--expected-revision` from a fresh read. Approvals additionally
bind `--approval-id` and `--candidate-digest`. Graph task credentials cannot
use these management commands.

Human users can also open the workspace Graph page and design a workflow in a
conversation with **Create with AI**: they name the participating agents, one
default executor and a final approver, and every later turn is an ordinary chat
message. The server does not generate anything itself — it runs that
conversation on the default executor's runtime, and a reply may end with one
`<graph_draft>` block holding a complete workflow definition, which the page
merges into the draft beside it as the reply arrives. The draft may spread its
steps across the participating agents, and it uses typed branches, parallel
paths and bounded loops when the description calls for them. Nothing is saved,
published or run by the conversation: the requester opens the editor, saves the
draft, then publishes and starts through the normal human controls. If no agent
can serve the conversation, manual creation remains available.

An agent answering in one of those conversations is a Graph authoring task, and
reads it with the task-scoped credential of that request — the same credential
rule as a Graph node. It needs no Graph-specific command: it replies in the chat
like any other task, and the contract for the `<graph_draft>` block arrives with
the turn. There is no submission budget — refine the definition for as many
turns as the requester keeps asking, exactly like any other conversation.

## PR linking and close intent are two distinct contracts

The GitHub webhook runs two separate scans over an incoming PR. They are not the
same gate and they read different fields.

**Linking** scans the PR **title, body, OR branch** for a routable issue key
(`PREFIX-NUMBER`, e.g. `MUL-2759`). Each match writes an issue ↔ PR link row.
This is the link that `multica issue pull-requests` reads back — but see the
reference-only rule below: a key that appears **only** as a bare mention in the
body is linked yet hidden from that list.

```text
MUL-2759: add built-in issue working skill        # title prefix → links, shown
agent/matt/mul-2759-working-on-issues             # branch ref   → links, shown
```

**Close intent** is stricter and is a separate scan over **title or body only —
never the branch**. It fires only for a key placed immediately after a closing
keyword (`Closes` / `Fixes` / `Resolves`, optional `:` then whitespace). That
adjacency is what sets the link row's close-intent flag, the gate that
auto-advances the issue to `done` when the PR merges.

```text
Closes MUL-2759                                    # links AND records close intent
Fixes MUL-2759
Resolves MUL-2759
Fix login MUL-2759                                 # links only — keyword not adjacent
```

Consequence: a bare title prefix or a branch reference links the PR but does not
close the issue on merge. A closing keyword immediately adjacent to the issue key
records close intent; on merge, that close intent can move the linked issue to
`done`.

**Reference-only links (hidden from the PR list).** A key that appears **only**
as a bare mention in the body — no closing keyword, and not in the title or
branch — still writes a link row, but the row is flagged `reference_only` and
**excluded from `multica issue pull-requests`** (and the issue's right-side PR
list in the UI). This keeps passing mentions like `Related MUL-2759` or
`Follow up in MUL-2759` from surfacing an unrelated PR as if it were working on
that issue. To make a PR show up for an issue, put the key in the title, the
branch, or after a closing keyword in the body — not as a loose body reference.

```text
Closes MUL-2759 in the body                        # links and shown
Related to MUL-2759 in the body (no title/branch)  # links but reference_only → hidden
```

### Default for code-changing issue work

When an issue run changes code in a checked-out GitHub repo, the default handoff
is to open or update a PR before posting the final Multica issue comment, unless
the user explicitly asked for a local-only change or no PR. This is a default, not
an unconditional command: if no code changed, say no PR is needed; if PR creation
is blocked by auth, failing tests, or missing remote state, report that blocker
instead of pretending the run is complete.

Use a routable issue key in the PR title, body, or branch so the webhook can link
the PR back to the issue. If the PR should close the issue on merge, put the key
immediately after a closing keyword in the title or body, for example:

```text
MUL-2759: fix login redirect        # links only
Closes MUL-2759                     # links and records close intent
```

In the final issue comment, include the PR URL when a PR exists. If the task did
not produce a PR because no code changed or the user asked not to create one, say
that explicitly.

## Reading a linked PR's real state

When a step depends on PR state, query Multica's link table — do not infer it
from branch names, GitHub search, memory, or `pr_url` metadata (which can be
stale).

```bash
multica issue pull-requests <issue-id> --output json
```

Returns `{"pull_requests": [...]}`. Each element exposes:

- `number`, `html_url`, `title`
- `state` — the PR lifecycle as a **single enum**, one of `merged`, `closed`,
  `draft`, `open`. There is no separate `draft` or `merged` boolean in the
  response; the server folds them into `state` (merged wins, then closed, then
  draft, else open).
- `merged_at` — non-null once merged; a second confirmation of `state: merged`.
- `provider` — `github`, `forgejo`, `gitea`, or `gitlab`.
- `mergeable_state` — mirrors GitHub (`clean` / `dirty` surfaced; other values
  round-trip as unknown; retained for compatibility).
- GitHub API snapshot fields: `snapshot_available`, `mergeable`,
  `merge_state_status`, `checks_rollup`, `checks_total`, `checks_passed`,
  `checks_failed`, `checks_running`, `failed_check_names`,
  `snapshot_fetched_at`, and `snapshot_stale`. `snapshot_available == true`
  means the feature is enabled and the snapshot matches the PR's current head.
  Only then does `checks_rollup == null` mean "no checks"; false means the
  snapshot feature is disabled, has not fetched yet, or only has an old head.
- `checks_conclusion` — coarse CI compatibility status: `passed`, `failed`,
  `pending`, or `null`. GitHub derives it from the current API snapshot;
  Forgejo/Gitea/GitLab derive it from webhook commit statuses. Backed by the
  provider-appropriate check counts.

So "is it merged?" is `state == "merged"` (or `merged_at != null`); "is it still
a draft?" is `state == "draft"`; coarse CI status is `checks_conclusion`.

If the command returns no linked PRs after a PR was opened, the link scanner did
not observe a routable issue key in the PR title/body/branch — or the only match
was a bare body mention, which links as `reference_only` and is hidden from this
list (see the reference-only rule above).

## Metadata: durable custom state

Metadata is a free-form KV bag of durable issue state. Reading metadata is safe.
Writing a metadata key is a state mutation and should be tied to an explicit
task requirement to record that state for later readers or runs. Keys are
whatever your workflow needs — the platform curates no vocabulary; pick short
snake_case names and reuse them consistently within your workspace.

Never store secrets, tokens, or API keys in metadata.
Not metadata: logs or summaries; runtime bookkeeping such as timestamps,
attempt counts, or agent IDs; or other single-run details such as
files touched and investigation notes — those belong in the result comment.

```bash
multica issue metadata set <issue-id> --key <key> --value <value>
multica issue metadata delete <issue-id> --key <stale-key>
```

`--value` is JSON-parsed by default (bool/number are sniffed); pass `--type
string|number|bool` to force a type.

## Custom properties: typed workflow state

Workspaces may define custom issue properties (Severity, Environment, QA
Status, ...). Properties are the typed, user-visible sibling of metadata:
values are validated against the definition (select options, date format,
http(s) URL), visible in the issue sidebar, and addressed by name.

- Read what exists before writing: `multica property list` shows the catalog;
  `multica issue property list <issue-id>` shows values set on the issue.
- Set values by property name and option name — the CLI translates to ids:

```bash
multica issue property set <issue-id> --name Environment --value staging
multica issue property set <issue-id> --name Platforms --value "iOS,Android"
multica issue property unset <issue-id> --name Environment
```

- A validation error lists the legal options — fix the value and retry.
- Definitions may include an optional catalog icon for visual identification;
  it does not change the property's type or value validation.
- Agents cannot create or edit property definitions (owner/admin humans only).
  If a needed property does not exist, propose it in a comment instead.
- Property vs metadata: if the value is workflow state a human should see and
  filter by, and a definition exists, prefer the property. Metadata stays the
  free-form bag for durable custom issue state.

## Status changes have server side effects

A status change is not cosmetic — the server enqueues or skips agent work based
on it. These are the contracts, not advice:

- **`backlog`** parks an agent-assigned issue: the assignee is set but no task
  fires. Moving `backlog → todo` (or any non-done/non-cancelled status) enqueues
  the assigned agent then.
- **`in_progress` / `in_review` on assignment runs** are agent-managed CLI
  mutations, not `StartTask` / `CompleteTask` side effects. The assignment
  runtime brief asks ordinary agents for `todo`/`backlog` → `in_progress` then
  `in_review` when they have delivered. Squad leaders share the opening
  `in_progress` step on the first assignment turn, keep the parent there while
  members work, and only move to `in_review` when a later re-trigger confirms
  the overall goal is met.
- **`in_review`** is an accepted issue status. Some workflows use it while a PR
  is open and awaiting review; moving to it is an explicit mutation.
- **`done`** on a child issue posts a system comment on its parent. If a PR
  carries close intent (`Closes MUL-XXXX`), it advances the issue to `done`
  itself on merge — you do not also need to flip it manually.
- **`cancelled`** is a terminal, user-driven decision to close the issue. Like
  `done` it enqueues no new agent work, but it does **not** stop tasks already in
  flight — a run in progress keeps going (MUL-4465). To stop a running task,
  cancel the task itself.
- **Failed issue-triggered tasks** may roll an issue from `in_progress` back to
  `todo` when no active task / retry remains — that is the main server-owned
  status write on the agent-run path.

## Claim ownership without duplicating a run

Assigning an active issue to an agent normally starts a run. When the work is
already underway and the write only records ownership or progress, pass
`--no-start` on every command in that flow — suppressing the assignment alone
does not suppress a later status update:

```bash
multica issue assign <issue-id> --to-id <agent-id> --no-start
multica issue update <issue-id> --assignee-id <agent-id> --no-start
multica issue status <issue-id> in_progress --no-start
```

Before self-assigning, check the target issue's comment history for an existing
claim and any `## Active sibling runs` block (its `run-messages` commands show
work in flight). The server also suppresses a trusted self-assignment when the
exact target `(issue, agent)` pair already has a non-terminal task, but it
deliberately keeps same-agent handoffs to a fresh issue starting runs: cross-issue
serial chains and triage batches rely on that.

## Sub-issues: `todo` starts work now, `backlog` parks it

On an agent-assigned issue, create status decides whether the assignee fires
immediately. A non-backlog status (e.g. `todo`) enqueues the agent at create
time; `backlog` sets the assignee without triggering.

Parallel children — all start now:

```bash
multica issue create --title "..." --parent <issue-id> --assignee <agent> --status todo
```

Strictly serial children — park later steps, promote one at a time:

```bash
multica issue create --title "Step 2: ..." --parent <issue-id> --assignee <agent> --status backlog
multica issue status <child-id> todo   # promote when the previous step is truly done
```

Creating every serial step as `todo` enqueues the whole chain at once.

### Stages: order sub-issues into barrier groups

`--stage <N>` (N ≥ 1) groups sub-issues under the same parent into ordered
stages. The parent assignee is woken **once, when a whole stage finishes** —
i.e. every sub-issue in the lowest unfinished stage has reached a terminal
status (`done`/`cancelled`). A completion that does not close a stage is silent
(no comment, no wake). A sibling set with **no** stages is one implicit stage,
so the parent is woken once when the *last* sub-issue finishes — not on every
child.

Advancement is agent-driven: the server only detects the closed barrier and
wakes the parent assignee, who then decides whether to promote the next stage's
`backlog` sub-issues to `todo`.

```bash
# Stage 1 runs now; later stages parked until promoted
multica issue create --title "Research A" --parent <id> --assignee <agent> --stage 1 --status todo
multica issue create --title "Research B" --parent <id> --assignee <agent> --stage 1 --status todo
multica issue create --title "Build"      --parent <id> --assignee <agent> --stage 2 --status backlog
multica issue create --title "Ship"       --parent <id> --assignee <agent> --stage 3 --status backlog
```

When both Stage 1 sub-issues finish you (the parent assignee) are woken with a
"Stage 1 complete" comment. Inspect the layout, then promote the next stage:

```bash
multica issue children <parent-id>             # sub-issues grouped by stage
multica issue status <stage-2-child-id> todo   # promote when its deps are met
```

Read each sub-issue's description before promoting and only promote items whose
stated dependencies are met; if a description conflicts with the parent's
breakdown, leave it `backlog` and comment to confirm first.

## Incorrect → correct

PR title (link the issue):

```text
Fix login redirect                  # incorrect — no issue key, won't link
MUL-2759: fix login redirect        # correct — links the PR
```

Serial / phased sub-issues (don't start the whole chain at once):

```bash
# incorrect — all fire immediately, no ordering
multica issue create --title "Step 2" --parent <issue-id> --assignee <agent> --status todo
multica issue create --title "Step 3" --parent <issue-id> --assignee <agent> --status todo

# correct — stage them; Stage 1 runs, later stages park and are promoted as
# each stage's barrier closes
multica issue create --title "Step 1" --parent <issue-id> --assignee <agent> --stage 1 --status todo
multica issue create --title "Step 2" --parent <issue-id> --assignee <agent> --stage 2 --status backlog
multica issue create --title "Step 3" --parent <issue-id> --assignee <agent> --stage 3 --status backlog
```
